# TwittterBot
A simple twitter bot for beginners.

The file logic.py contains python code for a simple entry level twitter bot.

Concept:
Using the twitter package for python, this bot searches for the latest tweet with a certain keyword, replaces the keyword with an alternate word, and tweets it back to the original tweeter with the new corrected tweet.

This bot is for introducing users to twitter bots in python and is at the same time a satire. The applications range from grammar nazi use to even censorship. Or maybe you prefer colour over color and think everyone should :P

This application runs on the users local machine as it is only for an educational purpose.
Future builds:
1) A version running on heroku.
2) Web application allowing user to key in keywords and replacement
3) Probably skynet :P
